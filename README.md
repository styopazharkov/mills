# Mills and Mancala AI
AI for the game of Mills(Nine men Morris) and Mancala

**Algorithm**

This AI uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the best possible move to make. 
Alpha beta pruning is used to make the algorithm faster.
The difficulty of the computer is how many moves ahead it looks. 
The heuristic used to determine the 'goodness' of a position for the computer is always updated based on game results, so it learns to bebetter and better.
